several types of public keys:
  - uncompressed (contain both X and Y coordinate of the ecdsa point)
  - compressed (contain sign of Y and X coordinate)
  
several types of address:
  -pay to public key (p2pk) (can use both compressed/uncompressed public key)
  -pay to public key (p2pkh) (can use both compressed/uncompressed public key hash)
  
  -pay to script hash (p2sh) (can use both compressed/uncompressed public key hash)
  
  
  -segwit: (for both case the public key MUST be compressed type)
    -pay to witness public key hash (p2wpkh)
    -pay to witness script hash (p2wsh)
     (both can be send inside a p2sh tx)
